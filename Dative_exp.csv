А кончилось всё тем, что выболтал почти все подробности приезда и отъезда родственничков! Не, не зря всё-таки про Грянулю ходили слухи ещё в Сибири, что он толи с нечистой силой знается, толи является! Вообще-то на меня это не похоже. Я что трезвый, что пьяный люблю поболтать. Но получить от меня ценную или опасную информацию в любом состоянии практически нереально. С удовольствием я выбалтываю только байки и/или дезинформацию! А тут так облажался!

Толи в пиво что-то подмешал, толи гипнозом каким воспользовался, толи ещё что-нибудь придумал! И, самое обидное, и предъявить-то мне ему, в общем-то, нечего!

Видимо тогда всей компании досталось сильно, и теперь они пытались всё и вся продезинфицировать.

The crew had to cancel the cruise and sent everyone home and to the hospitals. Apparently the whole company had a bad time, and now they were trying to disinfect everything and everyone. But I decided that I would better wash my hands 10 times a day in my cabin than to sprinkle them with this unknown substance.;Then we went to dinner.

И понятно, почему: сейчас любые активные действия в части интеграции, радикального изменения экономических отношений были бы не ко времени, потому что в Белоруссии политический кризис. Но тем не менее на один момент я бы хотел обратить внимание. Путин в публичных выступлениях уже третий раз за последние недели говорит о том, что абсолютно необходимо изменение Конституции, политическая реформа, проведение досрочных парламентских и президентских выборов. Именно в таких действиях он видит возможность выхода из этого кризиса. Ведь тот военно-политический зонтик, который Россия предоставила Лукашенко, не решает внутренние белорусские проблемы, в определенной степени лишь решает проблему внешнего воздействия на ситуацию в Белоруссии.

Когда приезжаешь на чемпионаты мира, понимаешь, что в Беларуси есть наука. Правда, участники международных конференций не знают о существовании Беларуси до тех пор, пока мы не выступим. Я в шоке до сих пор: в этом году «взорвал» конференцию Intel ISEF. Третья премия звучит неплохо, но на самом деле я в топ-3 мира, и меня обогнали только два американца. Причем чувак, который занял первое место, показывал только часть моего алгоритма. Он делал это при поддержке университета, а это была капец какая поддержка. Проиграть им мне было не обидно. Но Беларусь показывает крутые результаты, поднимается с колен, и это круто. Я создал свой сайт, и после конференции ко мне поступило около 400 предзаказов на AirPhone, причем практически все из Америки.;"- Things are cool with school science,"" said Vlad. - The topic is promoted by the High-Tech Park and the Minsk Regional Institute of Education Development.

I am still in shock: this year I ""blew up"" the Intel ISEF conference. Third prize sounds good, but in fact I'm in the top 3 in the world, and only two Americans overtook me. And the dude who took first place only showed part of my algorithm. He did it with the support of the university, and that was a hell of a lot of support. It did not hurt me to lose to them.

This year, Vlad ""blew away"" the Intel ISEF conference, placing 3rd in the world. He was only beaten by two Americans, one of whom presented part of Vlad's own algorithm with significant university support. Vlad was not upset to lose to them, as it shows Belarus is rising and producing impressive results. After the conference, Vlad created his own website and received around 400 pre-orders for his ""AirPhone"" product, mostly from the United States.

Прежде всего заметим, что ни Турция, ни Армения, активно участвуя в конфликте, признавать себя одной из сторон конфликта категорически отказываются. С чего бы такая ""скромность""? А с того, что признание себя одной из воюющих сторон создаёт массу проблем. Вспомните хоть ситуацию в Донбассе, где Украина всеми силами пытается представить Россию одной из воюющих сторон, от чего та категорически отказывается, но помогать Донбассу при этом не прекращает. Вот и в весьма похожей ситуации с Карабахом для России становиться одной из воюющих сторон крайне нежелательно, хотя Турция об этом буквально мечтает. Другое дело, что поскольку Армения является членом ОДКБ, то, если она по необходимости признает Карабах и вступит в войну на его стороне, помогать ей нам всё равно придётся, несмотря на все предшествующие политические кульбиты армянского премьер-министра Никола Пашиняна.

И хотя внешне может показаться, что партнер способен облагородить, сделать красивее и изящнее мою работу и инструменты, реально помочь мне ему будет довольно трудно по той простой причине, что сначала ему придется вникнуть в существо моих рабочих проблем, а это невозможно без достаточных усилий, которых партнер может вовсе не иметь в виду (Венера сама по себе не слишком трудолюбивая планета).;Having a beautiful wife is not the same as having just a wife - one has to match, and of course, work hard to ensure that one's diamond is set properly.

193;http://pizy.ru/dostavka-piccy-ot-piccerii-sorento-ulyanovsk/;Уже второй раз сталкиваюсь с безответственностью менеджеров и курьеров данной пиццерии. Первый случай произошел пару недель назад – заказывали пиццу с другом. Домофон в квартире не работал, поэтому курьер должен был позвонить, когда окажется у подъезда (менеджер об этом был уведомлен). Собственно, курьера мы увидели случайно, из окна – думали, сейчас позвонит, пойдем открывать. Прошло около 5ти минут – звонка не было. Решили спуститься к подъезду – курьера нигде не было, прошлись немного – в итоге встретили курьера уже на обратном пути к машине. На вопрос, где он ходил – он ответил, что искал нужный дом (во дворе было полно народу, но, видимо, спросить у них или позвонить нам ему не позволила религия). Получается, пиццу мы получили просто благодаря везению.;This is the second time I have encountered the irresponsibility of managers and couriers of this pizzeria. The first case happened a couple of weeks ago - we ordered pizza with a friend. The intercom in the apartment did not work, so the courier had to call when he was at the entrance (the manager was notified). Actually, the courier we saw accidentally, from the window - we thought, now will call, we'll go to open. About 5 minutes passed - there was no call. We decided to go down to the entrance - the courier was nowhere to be found, we walked a little - in the end we met the courier on the way back to the car. When asked where he went - he said that he was looking for the right house (the yard was full of people, but, apparently, to ask them or call us he did not allow religion). It turns out that we got the pizza simply due to luck. ;This is the second time I have come across the irresponsibility of the managers and couriers of this pizzeria.

А кончилось всё тем, что выболтал почти все подробности приезда и отъезда родственничков! Не, не зря всё-таки про Грянулю ходили слухи ещё в Сибири, что он толи с нечистой силой знается, толи является! Вообще-то на меня это не похоже. Я что трезвый, что пьяный люблю поболтать. Но получить от меня ценную или опасную информацию в любом состоянии практически нереально. С удовольствием я выбалтываю только байки и/или дезинформацию! А тут так облажался! Что-то здесь нечисто, в этом я уверен на все 287%! Сомнения у меня только по одному вопросу - как это Грязнуле удалось. Толи в пиво что-то подмешал, толи гипнозом каким воспользовался, толи ещё что-нибудь придумал! И, самое обидное, и предъявить-то мне ему, в общем-то, нечего! Пиво пил сам, никто мне в глотку силком его не заливал!; And it turned out so much worse than that! I felt like I was just a little drunk, chatting about general things with Muddy and Gela. I had ended up spilling almost all the details of the relatives' arrival and departure! He had been rumoured in Siberia for a reason, that he either had relations with the unclean powers, or was! Actually, it's not like me. I like to talk, drunk or sober. But it is almost impossible to get valuable or dangerous information from me in any condition. I'm only happy to spout tales and/or misinformation! And here I'm so fucked up! Something's fishy here, of that I'm 287% sure! The only doubt I have is how Muddy managed to do it. Either he put something in the beer, or he used hypnosis, or something else! And, most offensively, I had nothing to charge him with! I drank the beer myself, nobody forced it down my throat.;And it turned out much worse! It seems that I felt only slightly drunk, chatted on general topics with Dirty and Gela. And it all ended up blurting out almost all the details of the arrival and departure of relatives! No, it's not for nothing that there were rumors about Gryanulya back in Siberia that he knows something with evil spirits, or is! Actually, it's not like me. I'm either sober or drunk, I like to chat. But it is almost impossible to get valuable or dangerous information from me in any condition. With pleasure I blurt out only stories and/or misinformation! And then I screwed up so much! Something is not right here, I am 287% sure of that! I have doubts only on one question - how did the Dirty One manage it.

Но мама не хочет, она не хочет выздоравливать, она слышать не хочет, что кто-то будет заниматься ее телом, обращаться, как с маленькой, она привыкла все делать сама. Но противиться нам ей, к счастью, нечем. ""

Here is the translated passage from Russian to English:

""She lies there, cleaned by the nurse, with a thin braid thrown over her shoulder. Like a schoolgirl.

'Funny,' I say, 'you talked and talked, and now you're silent. Your tongue must be tired, I suppose.'

As I speak, she sobs unattractively. As I speak, her face contorts in suffering.

'Forgive me, forgive me, I joked, as always clumsily. I meant to say that this won't last long.'

And then mom bends her still-living left arm at the elbow, pointing a finger somewhere upwards.

I don't want to look where she points; I’m not the right person for this.

'Who saved you from a heart attack, from a fractured hip? Who even knows how to save you? Your son. Don’t worry, we'll get through this too.'

'The way you talk to her so skillfully,' the nurse says, switching to the formal 'you' in German. 'If mine could talk to me like this, I would have gotten up sooner.'

But mom doesn't want to, she doesn't want to get better, she doesn't want to hear that someone will be taking care of her body, treating her like a child. She is used to doing everything herself. But, fortunately, she has no means to resist us.""";"She lies there, worn out by the caregiver, with a thin braid draped over her shoulder, like a high school student.
""It's funny,"" I say, ""you were chatty before, but now you're silent. Your tongue must be tired.""
But what am I saying? She lets out an ugly sob, and her face wrinkles in agony.
""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I was just joking, as always, and it came out wrong. I meant to say that it won't be for long.""
And then my mom bends her still-living left arm at the elbow and points a finger upward.
I don't want to look where she's pointing; she's not attacking the right person.
""Who saved you from a heart attack, from a broken hip? Who knows how to save you at all? Your son. Don't worry, we'll get through this.""
""You talk to her so skillfully,"" the caregiver switches to formal address. ""If my family knew how to talk to me like that, I would have gotten up earlier.""

Вот и в весьма похожей ситуации с Карабахом для России становиться одной из воюющих сторон крайне нежелательно, хотя Турция об этом буквально мечтает. Другое дело, что поскольку Армения является членом ОДКБ, то, если она по необходимости признает Карабах и вступит в войну на его стороне, помогать ей нам всё равно придётся, несмотря на все предшествующие политические кульбиты армянского премьер-министра Никола Пашиняна.

Так, или примерно так, будет чувствовать муж, если сильная Венера его жены попадает ему в шестой дом. Вообще этот аспект довольно остро ставит вопрос: буду ли я служить красоте (или, скажем, социальному успеху) партнера, или же наоборот? И хотя внешне может показаться, что партнер способен облагородить, сделать красивее и изящнее мою работу и инструменты, реально помочь мне ему будет довольно трудно по той простой причине, что сначала ему придется вникнуть в существо моих рабочих проблем, а это невозможно без достаточных усилий, которых партнер может вовсе не иметь в виду (Венера сама по себе не слишком трудолюбивая планета).;Having a beautiful wife is not the same as having just a wife - one has to match, and of course, work hard to ensure that one's diamond is set properly. That is how, or so the husband will feel if his wife's powerful Venus is in the sixth house. In general, this aspect raises the question of whether I will serve my partner's beauty (or, say, social success), or vice versa. And while on the surface my partner may seem capable of beautifying and refining my work and tools, the reality of helping me is quite difficult for the simple reason that he first has to understand my work issues, and that is impossible without enough effort, which my partner may not have in mind at all (Venus is not a hardworking planet per se).;Having a beautiful wife is not at all the same as having just a wife - you have to match, and first of all, of course, work hard in order to provide your diamond with a decent frame.

Решили спуститься к подъезду – курьера нигде не было, прошлись немного – в итоге встретили курьера уже на обратном пути к машине.

А кончилось всё тем, что выболтал почти все подробности приезда и отъезда родственничков! Не, не зря всё-таки про Грянулю ходили слухи ещё в Сибири, что он толи с нечистой силой знается, толи является! Вообще-то на меня это не похоже. Я что трезвый, что пьяный люблю поболтать. Но получить от меня ценную или опасную информацию в любом состоянии практически нереально. С удовольствием я выбалтываю только байки и/или дезинформацию! А тут так облажался! Что-то здесь нечисто, в этом я уверен на все 287%! Сомнения у меня только по одному вопросу - как это Грязнуле удалось. Толи в пиво что-то подмешал, толи гипнозом каким воспользовался, толи ещё что-нибудь придумал! И, самое обидное, и предъявить-то мне ему, в общем-то, нечего! Пиво пил сам, никто мне в глотку силком его не заливал!; And it turned out so much worse than that! I felt like I was just a little drunk, chatting about general things with Muddy and Gela. I had ended up spilling almost all the details of the relatives' arrival and departure! He had been rumoured in Siberia for a reason, that he either had relations with the unclean powers, or was! Actually, it's not like me. I like to talk, drunk or sober. But it is almost impossible to get valuable or dangerous information from me in any condition. I'm only happy to spout tales and/or misinformation! And here I'm so fucked up! Something's fishy here, of that I'm 287% sure! The only doubt I have is how Muddy managed to do it.

В ресторане нам с маниакальной настойчивостью пытались побрызгать каким-то антисептиком на руки, но я стойко отбивалась, объясняя им, что у меня аллергия и испытывать на себе их новейшие достижения в области санитарной обработки мне не хочется. Товарищи настаивали, говоря, что ЭТО можно даже пить, но верить мне им не хотелось, вернее, хотелось попросить их ЭТО выпить и, отмахиваясь от них, как от назойливых мух, мне всё же удалось прорваться с боем в ресторан.

Видимо тогда всей компании досталось сильно, и теперь они пытались всё и вся продезинфицировать. Но я решила, что не сдамся без боя и лучше буду в своей каюте мыть руки по 10 раз в день, чем непонятно чем их обрызгивать.;Then we went to dinner. At the restaurant, they tried to sprinkle some kind of antiseptic on our hands with manic persistence, but I stubbornly fought them off, explaining that I was allergic and did not want to experience their latest advances in sanitary treatment on myself. My comrades insisted, saying that I could even drink it, but I did not want to believe them, or rather, I wanted to ask them to drink it, and, waving them away like pesky flies, I still managed to break through with a fight into the restaurant. The crew had to cancel the cruise and sent everyone home and to the hospitals. Apparently the whole company had a bad time, and now they were trying to disinfect everything and everyone.

И понятно, почему: сейчас любые активные действия в части интеграции, радикального изменения экономических отношений были бы не ко времени, потому что в Белоруссии политический кризис. Но тем не менее на один момент я бы хотел обратить внимание. Путин в публичных выступлениях уже третий раз за последние недели говорит о том, что абсолютно необходимо изменение Конституции, политическая реформа, проведение досрочных парламентских и президентских выборов. Именно в таких действиях он видит возможность выхода из этого кризиса. Ведь тот военно-политический зонтик, который Россия предоставила Лукашенко, не решает внутренние белорусские проблемы, в определенной степени лишь решает проблему внешнего воздействия на ситуацию в Белоруссии. А внутренние проблемы надо решать самой Белоруссии, Лукашенко в том числе. И здесь помочь ему нам очень сложно.;"- ""There was nothing to expect any radical statements and announcements after this meeting in the current situation - of course, everything remains inside there, we can only guess.

Причем чувак, который занял первое место, показывал только часть моего алгоритма. Он делал это при поддержке университета, а это была капец какая поддержка. Проиграть им мне было не обидно. Но Беларусь показывает крутые результаты, поднимается с колен, и это круто.

Прежде всего заметим, что ни Турция, ни Армения, активно участвуя в конфликте, признавать себя одной из сторон конфликта категорически отказываются. С чего бы такая ""скромность""? А с того, что признание себя одной из воюющих сторон создаёт массу проблем. Вспомните хоть ситуацию в Донбассе, где Украина всеми силами пытается представить Россию одной из воюющих сторон, от чего та категорически отказывается, но помогать Донбассу при этом не прекращает. Вот и в весьма похожей ситуации с Карабахом для России становиться одной из воюющих сторон крайне нежелательно, хотя Турция об этом буквально мечтает. Другое дело, что поскольку Армения является членом ОДКБ, то, если она по необходимости признает Карабах и вступит в войну на его стороне, помогать ей нам всё равно придётся, несмотря на все предшествующие политические кульбиты армянского премьер-министра Никола Пашиняна. ";"Therefore, when choosing its position, Russia should be guided not by feelings, but only by its own pragmatic interests. First of all, we note that neither Turkey nor Armenia, while actively participating in the conflict, categorically refuse to recognize themselves as a party to the conflict. Why such ""modesty""? Because the recognition of oneself as one of the belligerent sides creates a great number of problems. Remember the situation in Donbass, where Ukraine makes every effort to present Russia as one of the belligerents, which it categorically refuses to do, but does not stop helping Donbass. In a very similar situation with Karabakh, it is extremely undesirable for Russia to become one of the warring parties, although Turkey is literally dreaming about it.

И хотя внешне может показаться, что партнер способен облагородить, сделать красивее и изящнее мою работу и инструменты, реально помочь мне ему будет довольно трудно по той простой причине, что сначала ему придется вникнуть в существо моих рабочих проблем, а это невозможно без достаточных усилий, которых партнер может вовсе не иметь в виду (Венера сама по себе не слишком трудолюбивая планета).;Having a beautiful wife is not the same as having just a wife - one has to match, and of course, work hard to ensure that one's diamond is set properly.

Первый случай произошел пару недель назад – заказывали пиццу с другом. Домофон в квартире не работал, поэтому курьер должен был позвонить, когда окажется у подъезда (менеджер об этом был уведомлен). Собственно, курьера мы увидели случайно, из окна – думали, сейчас позвонит, пойдем открывать. Прошло около 5ти минут – звонка не было. Решили спуститься к подъезду – курьера нигде не было, прошлись немного – в итоге встретили курьера уже на обратном пути к машине. На вопрос, где он ходил – он ответил, что искал нужный дом (во дворе было полно народу, но, видимо, спросить у них или позвонить нам ему не позволила религия). Получается, пиццу мы получили просто благодаря везению.;This is the second time I have encountered the irresponsibility of managers and couriers of this pizzeria. The first case happened a couple of weeks ago - we ordered pizza with a friend. The intercom in the apartment did not work, so the courier had to call when he was at the entrance (the manager was notified). Actually, the courier we saw accidentally, from the window - we thought, now will call, we'll go to open. About 5 minutes passed - there was no call. We decided to go down to the entrance - the courier was nowhere to be found, we walked a little - in the end we met the courier on the way back to the car. When asked where he went - he said that he was looking for the right house (the yard was full of people, but, apparently, to ask them or call us he did not allow religion). It turns out that we got the pizza simply due to luck. ;This is the second time I have come across the irresponsibility of the managers and couriers of this pizzeria.

А кончилось всё тем, что выболтал почти все подробности приезда и отъезда родственничков! Не, не зря всё-таки про Грянулю ходили слухи ещё в Сибири, что он толи с нечистой силой знается, толи является! Вообще-то на меня это не похоже. Я что трезвый, что пьяный люблю поболтать. Но получить от меня ценную или опасную информацию в любом состоянии практически нереально. С удовольствием я выбалтываю только байки и/или дезинформацию! А тут так облажался! Что-то здесь нечисто, в этом я уверен на все 287%! Сомнения у меня только по одному вопросу - как это Грязнуле удалось. Толи в пиво что-то подмешал, толи гипнозом каким воспользовался, толи ещё что-нибудь придумал! И, самое обидное, и предъявить-то мне ему, в общем-то, нечего! Пиво пил сам, никто мне в глотку силком его не заливал!; And it turned out so much worse than that! I felt like I was just a little drunk, chatting about general things with Muddy and Gela. I had ended up spilling almost all the details of the relatives' arrival and departure! He had been rumoured in Siberia for a reason, that he either had relations with the unclean powers, or was! Actually, it's not like me. I like to talk, drunk or sober. But it is almost impossible to get valuable or dangerous information from me in any condition. I'm only happy to spout tales and/or misinformation! And here I'm so fucked up! Something's fishy here, of that I'm 287% sure! The only doubt I have is how Muddy managed to do it. Either he put something in the beer, or he used hypnosis, or something else! And, most offensively, I had nothing to charge him with! I drank the beer myself, nobody forced it down my throat.;And it turned out much worse! It seems that I felt only slightly drunk, chatted on general topics with Dirty and Gela. And it all ended up blurting out almost all the details of the arrival and departure of relatives!

Translate the following passage of from Russian to English:
""Она лежит, протертая сиделкой, с жиденькой косичкой, переброшенной через плечо. Как гимназистка.
– Смешно, – говорю я, – болтала-болтала, а теперь молчишь. Язык устал, наверное.
Что я говорю, она некрасиво всхлипывает, что я говорю, она морщит лицо в страдании.
– Прости, прости, я пошутил, как всегда неудачно. Я хотел сказать, что это ненадолго.
И тогда мама сгибает в локте пока еще живую левую руку, показывая пальцем куда-то вверх.
Я не хочу смотреть, куда она показывает, не на того напала.
– Кто тебя спас от инфаркта, от перелома шейки бедра? Кто вообще умеет тебя спасать? Твой сын. Не бойся, и это переживем.
– Как вы с ней ловко говорите, – переходит на “вы” сиделка. – Если бы мои умели так со мной говорить, я бы раньше поднялась.
Но мама не хочет, она не хочет выздоравливать, она слышать не хочет, что кто-то будет заниматься ее телом, обращаться, как с маленькой, она привыкла все делать сама. Но противиться нам ей, к счастью, нечем. ""

Here is the translated passage from Russian to English:

""She lies there, cleaned by the nurse, with a thin braid thrown over her shoulder. Like a schoolgirl.

'Funny,' I say, 'you talked and talked, and now you're silent. Your tongue must be tired, I suppose.'

As I speak, she sobs unattractively. As I speak, her face contorts in suffering.

'Forgive me, forgive me, I joked, as always clumsily. I meant to say that this won't last long.'

And then mom bends her still-living left arm at the elbow, pointing a finger somewhere upwards.

I don't want to look where she points; I’m not the right person for this.

'Who saved you from a heart attack, from a fractured hip? Who even knows how to save you? Your son. Don’t worry, we'll get through this too.'

Вот и в весьма похожей ситуации с Карабахом для России становиться одной из воюющих сторон крайне нежелательно, хотя Турция об этом буквально мечтает. Другое дело, что поскольку Армения является членом ОДКБ, то, если она по необходимости признает Карабах и вступит в войну на его стороне, помогать ей нам всё равно придётся, несмотря на все предшествующие политические кульбиты армянского премьер-министра Никола Пашиняна.

Similarly, in the situation with Karabakh, it is highly undesirable for Russia to become one of the warring parties, even though Turkey dreams of this. However, Armenia is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), and if it recognizes Karabakh out of necessity and enters the war on its side, we will still have to assist them, despite the previous political flip-flops of Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan.";CD2D1M;D2D1;CM;D2D1;n;1;Gemini;agent;y;y;y;y;y;y;y;y;;;;;0;;0;ей нам;ej nam;3SG;VERB;AP;yes;locuphoric;1013;;JSI;Information, professionell;infromative;infromative;Kontext;vor;Kontext;Personalpronomen, Eigenname;Kontext;13 19;себя одной из сторон конфликта, признание себя одной из воюющих сторон, массу проблем, ситуацию в Донбассе, Россию одной из воюющих сторон, весьма похожей ситуации с Карабахом для России, крайне нежелательно

Так, или примерно так, будет чувствовать муж, если сильная Венера его жены попадает ему в шестой дом. Вообще этот аспект довольно остро ставит вопрос: буду ли я служить красоте (или, скажем, социальному успеху) партнера, или же наоборот? И хотя внешне может показаться, что партнер способен облагородить, сделать красивее и изящнее мою работу и инструменты, реально помочь мне ему будет довольно трудно по той простой причине, что сначала ему придется вникнуть в существо моих рабочих проблем, а это невозможно без достаточных усилий, которых партнер может вовсе не иметь в виду (Венера сама по себе не слишком трудолюбивая планета).;Having a beautiful wife is not the same as having just a wife - one has to match, and of course, work hard to ensure that one's diamond is set properly. That is how, or so the husband will feel if his wife's powerful Venus is in the sixth house.

And while on the surface my partner may seem capable of beautifying and refining my work and tools, the reality of helping me is quite difficult for the simple reason that he first has to understand my work issues, and that is impossible without enough effort, which my partner may not have in mind at all (Venus is not a hardworking planet per se).;Having a beautiful wife is not at all the same as having just a wife - you have to match, and first of all, of course, work hard in order to provide your diamond with a decent frame.

А кончилось всё тем, что выболтал почти все подробности приезда и отъезда родственничков! Не, не зря всё-таки про Грянулю ходили слухи ещё в Сибири, что он толи с нечистой силой знается, толи является! Вообще-то на меня это не похоже. Я что трезвый, что пьяный люблю поболтать. Но получить от меня ценную или опасную информацию в любом состоянии практически нереально. С удовольствием я выбалтываю только байки и/или дезинформацию! А тут так облажался! Что-то здесь нечисто, в этом я уверен на все 287%! Сомнения у меня только по одному вопросу - как это Грязнуле удалось. Толи в пиво что-то подмешал, толи гипнозом каким воспользовался, толи ещё что-нибудь придумал! И, самое обидное, и предъявить-то мне ему, в общем-то, нечего! Пиво пил сам, никто мне в глотку силком его не заливал!; And it turned out so much worse than that! I felt like I was just a little drunk, chatting about general things with Muddy and Gela. I had ended up spilling almost all the details of the relatives' arrival and departure! He had been rumoured in Siberia for a reason, that he either had relations with the unclean powers, or was! Actually, it's not like me. I like to talk, drunk or sober. But it is almost impossible to get valuable or dangerous information from me in any condition. I'm only happy to spout tales and/or misinformation! And here I'm so fucked up! Something's fishy here, of that I'm 287% sure! The only doubt I have is how Muddy managed to do it. Either he put something in the beer, or he used hypnosis, or something else! And, most offensively, I had nothing to charge him with! I drank the beer myself, nobody forced it down my throat.;And it turned out much worse! It seems that I felt only slightly drunk, chatted on general topics with Dirty and Gela. And it all ended up blurting out almost all the details of the arrival and departure of relatives! No, it's not for nothing that there were rumors about Gryanulya back in Siberia that he knows something with evil spirits, or is! Actually, it's not like me. I'm either sober or drunk, I like to chat. But it is almost impossible to get valuable or dangerous information from me in any condition. With pleasure I blurt out only stories and/or misinformation! And then I screwed up so much! Something is not right here, I am 287% sure of that! I have doubts only on one question - how did the Dirty One manage it. Either he mixed something into the beer, or he used hypnosis, or he came up with something else! And, most offensively, there is nothing to show him to me, in general!

В ресторане нам с маниакальной настойчивостью пытались побрызгать каким-то антисептиком на руки, но я стойко отбивалась, объясняя им, что у меня аллергия и испытывать на себе их новейшие достижения в области санитарной обработки мне не хочется.

Видимо тогда всей компании досталось сильно, и теперь они пытались всё и вся продезинфицировать.

The crew had to cancel the cruise and sent everyone home and to the hospitals. Apparently the whole company had a bad time, and now they were trying to disinfect everything and everyone.

Но тем не менее на один момент я бы хотел обратить внимание. Путин в публичных выступлениях уже третий раз за последние недели говорит о том, что абсолютно необходимо изменение Конституции, политическая реформа, проведение досрочных парламентских и президентских выборов. Именно в таких действиях он видит возможность выхода из этого кризиса. Ведь тот военно-политический зонтик, который Россия предоставила Лукашенко, не решает внутренние белорусские проблемы, в определенной степени лишь решает проблему внешнего воздействия на ситуацию в Белоруссии. А внутренние проблемы надо решать самой Белоруссии, Лукашенко в том числе.

Прежде всего заметим, что ни Турция, ни Армения, активно участвуя в конфликте, признавать себя одной из сторон конфликта категорически отказываются. С чего бы такая ""скромность""? А с того, что признание себя одной из воюющих сторон создаёт массу проблем. Вспомните хоть ситуацию в Донбассе, где Украина всеми силами пытается представить Россию одной из воюющих сторон, от чего та категорически отказывается, но помогать Донбассу при этом не прекращает. Вот и в весьма похожей ситуации с Карабахом для России становиться одной из воюющих сторон крайне нежелательно, хотя Турция об этом буквально мечтает. Другое дело, что поскольку Армения является членом ОДКБ, то, если она по необходимости признает Карабах и вступит в войну на его стороне, помогать ей нам всё равно придётся, несмотря на все предшествующие политические кульбиты армянского премьер-министра Никола Пашиняна. ";"Therefore, when choosing its position, Russia should be guided not by feelings, but only by its own pragmatic interests. First of all, we note that neither Turkey nor Armenia, while actively participating in the conflict, categorically refuse to recognize themselves as a party to the conflict. Why such ""modesty""? Because the recognition of oneself as one of the belligerent sides creates a great number of problems. Remember the situation in Donbass, where Ukraine makes every effort to present Russia as one of the belligerents, which it categorically refuses to do, but does not stop helping Donbass. In a very similar situation with Karabakh, it is extremely undesirable for Russia to become one of the warring parties, although Turkey is literally dreaming about it.

There wasn't much of interest—drills, the oath, more drills. But on exactly March 17, right after the referendum in Crimea, we went there on our first deployment. A convoy of ten vehicles carried humanitarian supplies for the military—food, ammunition, soap, refrigerators, furniture. Without any proper explanation, we were roused at night under alert, lined up, and given a brief briefing. Firstly, we were forbidden to stop independently. In the event of an accident, we were to report it via radio to the first vehicle, where the convoy leader was. He would make further decisions. Secondly, upon entering the territory of the peninsula, we were instructed not to engage with local residents, journalists, other servicemen—anyone.

Так, или примерно так, будет чувствовать муж, если сильная Венера его жены попадает ему в шестой дом. Вообще этот аспект довольно остро ставит вопрос: буду ли я служить красоте (или, скажем, социальному успеху) партнера, или же наоборот? И хотя внешне может показаться, что партнер способен облагородить, сделать красивее и изящнее мою работу и инструменты, реально помочь мне ему будет довольно трудно по той простой причине, что сначала ему придется вникнуть в существо моих рабочих проблем, а это невозможно без достаточных усилий, которых партнер может вовсе не иметь в виду (Венера сама по себе не слишком трудолюбивая планета).;Having a beautiful wife is not the same as having just a wife - one has to match, and of course, work hard to ensure that one's diamond is set properly. That is how, or so the husband will feel if his wife's powerful Venus is in the sixth house. In general, this aspect raises the question of whether I will serve my partner's beauty (or, say, social success), or vice versa. And while on the surface my partner may seem capable of beautifying and refining my work and tools, the reality of helping me is quite difficult for the simple reason that he first has to understand my work issues, and that is impossible without enough effort, which my partner may not have in mind at all (Venus is not a hardworking planet per se).;Having a beautiful wife is not at all the same as having just a wife - you have to match, and first of all, of course, work hard in order to provide your diamond with a decent frame.

And although it may seem externally that the partner is capable of refining, making my work and tools more beautiful and elegant, in reality, it will be quite difficult for him to help me for the simple reason that he will first have to understand the essence of my work-related problems, which is impossible without sufficient effort, which the partner may not have in mind at all (Venus itself is not a very hardworking planet).;CD2D1M;D2D1;CM;D2D1;n;1;Perplexity;agent;y;y;n;y;y;y;y;y;"""И хотя внешне может показаться, что партнер способен облагородить, сделать красивее и изящнее мою работу и инструменты"" (And although it may seem from the outside that the partner is able to ennoble, make my work and tools more beautiful and elegant) - This sentence acknowledges that the wife's beauty and social success could have a positive impact on the husband's work. However, the author argues that this is not as easy as it may seem.

""реально помочь мне ему будет довольно трудно по той простой причине, что сначала ему придется вникнуть в существо моих рабочих проблем"" (it will be quite difficult for him to really help me for the simple reason that first he will have to delve into the essence of my work problems) - This sentence explains why it will be difficult for the wife to help the husband with his work.

Первый случай произошел пару недель назад – заказывали пиццу с другом. Домофон в квартире не работал, поэтому курьер должен был позвонить, когда окажется у подъезда (менеджер об этом был уведомлен). Собственно, курьера мы увидели случайно, из окна – думали, сейчас позвонит, пойдем открывать. Прошло около 5ти минут – звонка не было. Решили спуститься к подъезду – курьера нигде не было, прошлись немного – в итоге встретили курьера уже на обратном пути к машине. На вопрос, где он ходил – он ответил, что искал нужный дом (во дворе было полно народу, но, видимо, спросить у них или позвонить нам ему не позволила религия). Получается, пиццу мы получили просто благодаря везению.;This is the second time I have encountered the irresponsibility of managers and couriers of this pizzeria.

We decided to go down to the entrance - the courier was nowhere to be found, we walked a little - in the end we met the courier on the way back to the car. When asked where he went - he said that he was looking for the right house (the yard was full of people, but, apparently, to ask them or call us he did not allow religion).

А кончилось всё тем, что выболтал почти все подробности приезда и отъезда родственничков! Не, не зря всё-таки про Грянулю ходили слухи ещё в Сибири, что он толи с нечистой силой знается, толи является! Вообще-то на меня это не похоже. Я что трезвый, что пьяный люблю поболтать. Но получить от меня ценную или опасную информацию в любом состоянии практически нереально. С удовольствием я выбалтываю только байки и/или дезинформацию! А тут так облажался!

Толи в пиво что-то подмешал, толи гипнозом каким воспользовался, толи ещё что-нибудь придумал! И, самое обидное, и предъявить-то мне ему, в общем-то, нечего!

Когда приезжаешь на чемпионаты мира, понимаешь, что в Беларуси есть наука. Правда, участники международных конференций не знают о существовании Беларуси до тех пор, пока мы не выступим. Я в шоке до сих пор: в этом году «взорвал» конференцию Intel ISEF. Третья премия звучит неплохо, но на самом деле я в топ-3 мира, и меня обогнали только два американца. Причем чувак, который занял первое место, показывал только часть моего алгоритма. Он делал это при поддержке университета, а это была капец какая поддержка. Проиграть им мне было не обидно. Но Беларусь показывает крутые результаты, поднимается с колен, и это круто. Я создал свой сайт, и после конференции ко мне поступило около 400 предзаказов на AirPhone, причем практически все из Америки.;"- Things are cool with school science,"" said Vlad. - The topic is promoted by the High-Tech Park and the Minsk Regional Institute of Education Development.

This year, Vlad ""blew away"" the Intel ISEF conference, placing 3rd in the world. He was only beaten by two Americans, one of whom presented part of Vlad's own algorithm with significant university support. Vlad was not upset to lose to them, as it shows Belarus is rising and producing impressive results. After the conference, Vlad created his own website and received around 400 pre-orders for his ""AirPhone"" product, mostly from the United States.

Прежде всего заметим, что ни Турция, ни Армения, активно участвуя в конфликте, признавать себя одной из сторон конфликта категорически отказываются. С чего бы такая ""скромность""? А с того, что признание себя одной из воюющих сторон создаёт массу проблем. Вспомните хоть ситуацию в Донбассе, где Украина всеми силами пытается представить Россию одной из воюющих сторон, от чего та категорически отказывается, но помогать Донбассу при этом не прекращает. Вот и в весьма похожей ситуации с Карабахом для России становиться одной из воюющих сторон крайне нежелательно, хотя Турция об этом буквально мечтает. Другое дело, что поскольку Армения является членом ОДКБ, то, если она по необходимости признает Карабах и вступит в войну на его стороне, помогать ей нам всё равно придётся, несмотря на все предшествующие политические кульбиты армянского премьер-министра Никола Пашиняна. ";"Therefore, when choosing its position, Russia should be guided not by feelings, but only by its own pragmatic interests. First of all, we note that neither Turkey nor Armenia, while actively participating in the conflict, categorically refuse to recognize themselves as a party to the conflict. Why such ""modesty""? Because the recognition of oneself as one of the belligerent sides creates a great number of problems. Remember the situation in Donbass, where Ukraine makes every effort to present Russia as one of the belligerents, which it categorically refuses to do, but does not stop helping Donbass. In a very similar situation with Karabakh, it is extremely undesirable for Russia to become one of the warring parties, although Turkey is literally dreaming about it. Another thing is that since Armenia is a member of the CSTO, if it has to recognize Karabakh and enter the war on its side, we will still have to help it, despite all the previous political twists and turns of the Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan.

Так, или примерно так, будет чувствовать муж, если сильная Венера его жены попадает ему в шестой дом. Вообще этот аспект довольно остро ставит вопрос: буду ли я служить красоте (или, скажем, социальному успеху) партнера, или же наоборот? И хотя внешне может показаться, что партнер способен облагородить, сделать красивее и изящнее мою работу и инструменты, реально помочь мне ему будет довольно трудно по той простой причине, что сначала ему придется вникнуть в существо моих рабочих проблем, а это невозможно без достаточных усилий, которых партнер может вовсе не иметь в виду (Венера сама по себе не слишком трудолюбивая планета).;Having a beautiful wife is not the same as having just a wife - one has to match, and of course, work hard to ensure that one's diamond is set properly. That is how, or so the husband will feel if his wife's powerful Venus is in the sixth house.

And while on the surface my partner may seem capable of beautifying and refining my work and tools, the reality of helping me is quite difficult for the simple reason that he first has to understand my work issues, and that is impossible without enough effort, which my partner may not have in mind at all (Venus is not a hardworking planet per se).;Having a beautiful wife is not at all the same as having just a wife - you have to match, and first of all, of course, work hard in order to provide your diamond with a decent frame.

The intercom in the apartment was not working, so the courier was supposed to call when he arrived at the entrance (the manager was informed about this). Actually, we saw the courier by chance from the window – we thought he would call soon, and we would go to open the door. About 5 minutes passed – there was no call. We decided to go down to the entrance – the courier was nowhere to be found. We walked around a bit and eventually met the courier already on his way back to the car. When we asked where he had been, he replied that he was looking for the right house (the courtyard was full of people, but apparently, his religion did not allow him to ask them or call us). So, we got the pizza just by sheer luck.""";;CD2D1M;D2D1;CM;D2D1;n;1;GPTTurbo;agent;n;y;y;y;y;y;y;;;;;;0;;1;;nam jemu;OBJC;VERB;PA;no;aliophoric;767;;TENTEN;;;;;;;;;;

А кончилось всё тем, что выболтал почти все подробности приезда и отъезда родственничков! Не, не зря всё-таки про Грянулю ходили слухи ещё в Сибири, что он толи с нечистой силой знается, толи является! Вообще-то на меня это не похоже. Я что трезвый, что пьяный люблю поболтать. Но получить от меня ценную или опасную информацию в любом состоянии практически нереально. С удовольствием я выбалтываю только байки и/или дезинформацию! А тут так облажался! Что-то здесь нечисто, в этом я уверен на все 287%! Сомнения у меня только по одному вопросу - как это Грязнуле удалось. Толи в пиво что-то подмешал, толи гипнозом каким воспользовался, толи ещё что-нибудь придумал! И, самое обидное, и предъявить-то мне ему, в общем-то, нечего! Пиво пил сам, никто мне в глотку силком его не заливал!; And it turned out so much worse than that! I felt like I was just a little drunk, chatting about general things with Muddy and Gela. I had ended up spilling almost all the details of the relatives' arrival and departure! He had been rumoured in Siberia for a reason, that he either had relations with the unclean powers, or was! Actually, it's not like me. I like to talk, drunk or sober. But it is almost impossible to get valuable or dangerous information from me in any condition. I'm only happy to spout tales and/or misinformation! And here I'm so fucked up! Something's fishy here, of that I'm 287% sure! The only doubt I have is how Muddy managed to do it. Either he put something in the beer, or he used hypnosis, or something else! And, most offensively, I had nothing to charge him with! I drank the beer myself, nobody forced it down my throat.;And it turned out much worse! It seems that I felt only slightly drunk, chatted on general topics with Dirty and Gela. And it all ended up blurting out almost all the details of the arrival and departure of relatives! No, it's not for nothing that there were rumors about Gryanulya back in Siberia that he knows something with evil spirits, or is! Actually, it's not like me. I'm either sober or drunk, I like to chat. But it is almost impossible to get valuable or dangerous information from me in any condition. With pleasure I blurt out only stories and/or misinformation! And then I screwed up so much! Something is not right here, I am 287% sure of that! I have doubts only on one question - how did the Dirty One manage it. Either he mixed something into the beer, or he used hypnosis, or he came up with something else! And, most offensively, there is nothing to show him to me, in general! I drank beer myself, no one forced it down my throat!;And it turned out much worse! It seems that he felt only slightly drunk, chatting on general topics with Gryaznulya and Gela.

А с того, что признание себя одной из воюющих сторон создаёт массу проблем. Вспомните хоть ситуацию в Донбассе, где Украина всеми силами пытается представить Россию одной из воюющих сторон, от чего та категорически отказывается, но помогать Донбассу при этом не прекращает. Вот и в весьма похожей ситуации с Карабахом для России становиться одной из воюющих сторон крайне нежелательно, хотя Турция об этом буквально мечтает. Другое дело, что поскольку Армения является членом ОДКБ, то, если она по необходимости признает Карабах и вступит в войну на его стороне, помогать ей нам всё равно придётся, несмотря на все предшествующие политические кульбиты армянского премьер-министра Никола Пашиняна.

Так, или примерно так, будет чувствовать муж, если сильная Венера его жены попадает ему в шестой дом. Вообще этот аспект довольно остро ставит вопрос: буду ли я служить красоте (или, скажем, социальному успеху) партнера, или же наоборот? И хотя внешне может показаться, что партнер способен облагородить, сделать красивее и изящнее мою работу и инструменты, реально помочь мне ему будет довольно трудно по той простой причине, что сначала ему придется вникнуть в существо моих рабочих проблем, а это невозможно без достаточных усилий, которых партнер может вовсе не иметь в виду (Венера сама по себе не слишком трудолюбивая планета).;Having a beautiful wife is not the same as having just a wife - one has to match, and of course, work hard to ensure that one's diamond is set properly. That is how, or so the husband will feel if his wife's powerful Venus is in the sixth house. In general, this aspect raises the question of whether I will serve my partner's beauty (or, say, social success), or vice versa. And while on the surface my partner may seem capable of beautifying and refining my work and tools, the reality of helping me is quite difficult for the simple reason that he first has to understand my work issues, and that is impossible without enough effort, which my partner may not have in mind at all (Venus is not a hardworking planet per se).;Having a beautiful wife is not at all the same as having just a wife - you have to match, and first of all, of course, work hard in order to provide your diamond with a decent frame. So, or something like that, a husband will feel if his wife's strong Venus gets into his sixth house. In general, this aspect rather sharply raises the question: will I serve the beauty (or, say, social success) of a partner, or vice versa? And although it may seem outwardly that the partner is able to refine, make my work and tools more beautiful and elegant, it will be quite difficult for him to really help me for the simple reason that first he will have to delve into the essence of my work problems, and this is impossible without sufficient efforts, which the partner may not have in mind at all (Venus not a very hardworking planet in itself).;Having a beautiful wife is not at all the same as having just a wife - you have to comply, and first of all, of course, work hard in order to provide your diamond with a decent setting.

Первый случай произошел пару недель назад – заказывали пиццу с другом. Домофон в квартире не работал, поэтому курьер должен был позвонить, когда окажется у подъезда (менеджер об этом был уведомлен). Собственно, курьера мы увидели случайно, из окна – думали, сейчас позвонит, пойдем открывать. Прошло около 5ти минут – звонка не было. Решили спуститься к подъезду – курьера нигде не было, прошлись немного – в итоге встретили курьера уже на обратном пути к машине. На вопрос, где он ходил – он ответил, что искал нужный дом (во дворе было полно народу, но, видимо, спросить у них или позвонить нам ему не позволила религия). Получается, пиццу мы получили просто благодаря везению.;This is the second time I have encountered the irresponsibility of managers and couriers of this pizzeria.
